# country_territory_population
SQL project. Data is forked from (https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/ad4f6abbaac0a48aa781) and has been updated with my analysis.

The sql file has queries from the original data. I sought to find factors that influenced population of countries around the world. From the data, some of the columns had correlations but drawing it back to population increase, there seemed to not be a correlation.

1. I looked at the fertility rates of the top 10 most populated countries. with the exception of Nigeria and another country, the top countries had low fertility rates. 

2. There was also the median ages of the population, but then again the two exceptions in the first instance, had very youthful population which meant higher reproductive ability.

Go through the project and suggest alternative ways I could have done the analysis. I enjoyed the queries and the confusion. I was expecting to have factors like net migrants, median age, fertility rates pointing to the increase in population across the overpopulated countries. But there was no direct link per the analysis.

Also there were countries that had bigger land sizes but had low net migrants going there. My theory is that there are more parameters contributing to population increase.
